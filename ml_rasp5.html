<title>ML on Raspberry 5</title>

<h1>Lay of the Land</h1>
Thrusted out of the familiar and into the strange or: what to do when you can't use CUDA.

I just got the Raspberry Pi 5 (RP5) and being an ML engineer my first thought is seeing what I can cram onto here.

The RP5 has a GPU onboard (TODO: GPU; videocore something...?) so naturally I want to tap into it for ML purposes.

However, as previously said this ain't no Nvidia sota GPU we're going to have to explore alternatives

<h2>OpenGL? No, wait, Open<i>CL</i></h2>
Initially, I admit I was confused by this one word difference but this is how it goes:
<ul>
    Both use the GPU
</ul>
<ul>
    The "G" OpenGL is for <i>graphics</i> and so it's primarily used for video games, rendering, etc. Not as general as...
</ul>
<ul>
    OpenCL where the "C" stands for "compute" but... don't quote me on that. Anyways, this is more general but <i>guess what!</i> 
    It's not really for the RP5. It seems at some point someone did a master theses on this (TODO:cite) but that was long ago and for the RP3... 
</ul>

<h2>Onto Vulkan</h2>
So Vulkan <i>is</i> accessible on my RP5 and can even be used by Pytorch (if you're willing to jump through some hoops...)

My eyes are set on setting up Vulkan which was made easy thanks to <a href="https://qengineering.eu/install-vulkan-on-raspberry-pi.html">this tutorial</a>
<i>P.S. they say PiKISS isn't available for 64-bit but that was at the time of writing and is now available making Vulkan installation easy peezy</i>

Ok...but it seems that we can only use Vulkan 1.2...? And the latest is now 1.3+? Drats.
